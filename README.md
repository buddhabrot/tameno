## A (meta) list of non-profit/charity/ngo software projects.

Looking for charity initiatives to improve your skills as a software engineer, or just to help out others? After all, software is the ultimate way to scale problem solving!
I was doing the same and will compile this list as I'm going through the search.

Since I am located in Belgium the list will grow geographically centered in this area. 
However I would urge not to discriminate between geographies and include all initiatives that support English speaking software engineers.

Please contribute to improve quality and volume of the initiatives.
